This part of our relationship is when i knew that you cared about me, that you chose that I, am worthy of your love and all the care in this world because you made me your baby, your little boy who you adore and i don't think i can ever ever more be thankful to you more than i am for that, because of you. OU. You changed my life, you made it the best thing I'll ever have and you are the one who gave me hope that life can suck but it will be the best and if anything is the best it's only because of you in my life my sweetheart little princesssssssssssss</p>

                            <p>Happy birthday to meeeeeeeeee, I never thought I'd be so happy or excited for my bday ykk like um we're just 8 days in July and idk, I still go back to those pdfs you sent me because it warms my heart to know that im loved so much by you that you think that I matter to stay happy and enjoy my bday and not just stay sad like I was, I really wasn't excited for my bday yk that, from how I had a fight with my parents to how nobody was talking to me and everything felt it was going down but you just like always stood there, had my back and made me realise that i'm worth of being happy, that i'm worth enough of living because idk. I wanted to just die of how shitty I was feeling before but idk sometime which I've spent with you made me realise what my life is. My life is you Sumithra, Sumithra Marukala, it's all you, from the point when I wake up and shit to the point where I shit and sleep, you're there with me (pls laugh It was a funny joke) and I want to give it all back to you with all of it embedded in my love even more and make you feel so so happy because if anyone deserves all the happiness in the world, its you my baby.</p>
